# Milestone 0 - Project Bootstrap

This milestone verifies the base Vite + React project builds locally.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` (requires internet access).
2. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

Due to environment limitations in this repository, `npm install` may fail
without internet connectivity. Ensure packages are installed before running
the development server.
