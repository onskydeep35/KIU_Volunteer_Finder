# Milestone 8 - My Submissions Page

Allows volunteers to track the status of their applications.

## Added
- `MySubmissions` page listing the current userâ€™s applications with a **Cancel** action.
- Route for `/my-submissions` in `App.tsx`.
- `currentUserName` constant in `dummyData.ts`.

## Usage
All application data is in-memory so canceling a submission only lasts until refresh.
Run linting with `npm run lint`.
